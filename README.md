# Scala-99

Project created to learn Scala 3 by solving problems from [here](http://aperiodic.net/phil/scala/s-99/)

To make it simply, I created sbt script generating boilerplate for each problem. Can be run on root repository directory with:

    sbt 'createProblem i'

where i is an integer meaning which problem is going to be solved.
